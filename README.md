# SKÄLM

Skälm is a Rogue-clone. We created this game during October of 2022 as part of a school project about object oriented programming.

Move towards enemies to attack them.
Interact with 'E' to unlock and open doors and pick up items. 
Open the inventory with 'I', use 'Enter' to equip or use items, and 'E' to discard items.
Use 'Escape' to cancel out of menus.

Some features:
- There is support for preconstructed maps (more can be added in the data/maps folder) as well as procedurally generated maps.
- You can add your own music in the data/audio folder. It must be .wav-format. Simply select the song in the options menu after launching the game
- The settings.txt file can be fiddled with as you please, at your own risk. 
  If something gets too messed up you can simply delete the file and Skälm will simply generate a new one.

Some caveats:
- Don't resize the console window, or you'll have to restart the game.
- There is a slight risk of being softlocked if you are unlucky with key placements. Take care when planning your route.
- The game is not very balanced due to time constraints.
